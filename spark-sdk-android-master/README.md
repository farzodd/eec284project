# Particle (_formerly Spark_) Android Cloud SDK

**Note:** _This documentation is still undergoing minor construction; some info here may not yet be fully updated/corrected._

<!---
Android Cloud SDK
=======
-->

The Particle Android Cloud SDK enables Android apps to interact with Particle-powered connected products using the Particle Cloud. Itâ€™s an easy-to-use wrapper for Particle REST API. The Cloud SDK will allow you to:

- Get a list of a user's Particle devices.
- Read variables from devices.
- Invoke functions on devices.
- Manage access tokens for the Particle Cloud.
- Claim & unclaim devices for a user account.
- *(Coming Soon)* Publish events from the mobile app and subscribe to events coming from devices.


**Rebranding notice**

Spark recently rebranded as Particle!  In the 0.2.0 release of the SDK, classes like
`ParticleCloud` and `ParticleDevice` have been replaced with `ParticleCloud` and 
`ParticleDevice`, _et al._


**Beta notice**

This SDK is still under development and is currently in beta.  Although it is tested and mostly API-stable, bugs and other issues may be present, and the API may change prior to leaving beta.


## Getting Started

The SDK is available as a Gradle dependency via [JCenter](https://bintray.com/particle/android/cloud-sdk/).  See the [Installation](#android-cloud-sdk-installation) section for more details.
**Spoiler**: just add `compile 'io.particle:cloudsdk:0.2.2'` to your `build.gradle`

You can also [download the SDK as a zip](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-android/archive/master.zip).

For some usage examples, check out [Usage](#android-cloud-sdk-usage) below, or play with the `example_app` module included in the git repository.

## Usage

**NOTE:**  All SDK methods are intentionally implemented as synchronous, blocking calls, including network calls.  This blocking API avoids nested callbacks and other complexity, making it easy to write a series of synchronous calls while on a non-UI thread.

To spare developers some of the awkwardness of making asynchronous calls and returning results back to the UI thread, we have supplied the `Async` and `ApiWork` set of convenience classes, a purpose-built wrapper around `AsyncTask` for use with these APIs.  ([Extras](#android-cloud-sdk-usage-extras) has more info on this.)


Cloud SDK usage mostly involves two main classes:

1. `ParticleCloud` is a singleton which enables all basic cloud operations such as: user authentication, retrieving a device list, claiming, and more.
2. `ParticleDevice` instances represent a claimed device.  Each instance enables device-specific operations: invoking functions, reading variables, and getting basic info about the device, such as name and version info.

### Extras

The SDK also ships with a handful of helpful utility classes:

- `Async.executeAsync` is a purpose-built wrapper around AsyncTask.  Usage information for this class follows in the API examples below.
- `Toaster`: is another boilerplate eliminator.  `Toast.makeToast(blah blah blah)` is absurd, when all you really wanted was an ultra-lightweight way to say "put this string on the screen for a sec".  `Toaster` makes this dream come true!
- `EZ`: contains miscellaneous shortcuts for reducing boilerplate which have no simple taxonomic classification.
- `Py`: There's nothing Particle or Android specific about this, but it's worth calling out.  This class brings a little Pythonic joy to your Java, like easy collection constructors (e.g.: `list()` and `set()`), and a _truthiness_ check named `truthy()`.  See the source for this class for additional documentation on this class.

Here are few examples for the most common use cases to get your started:

#### Log in to the Particle cloud

```java
Async.executeAsync(ParticleCloud.get(myView.getContext()), new Async.ApiWork<ParticleCloud, Void>() {

        public void callApi(ParticleCloud particleCloud) throws ParticleCloudException, IOException {
            particleCloud.logIn("ido@particle.io","l33tp4ssw0rd");
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Void aVoid) {
            Toaster.l(myActivity.this, "Logged in");
            // start new activity...
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(ParticleCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
            Toaster.l(myActicity.this, "Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
        }
});

```
---


#### Get a list of all devices for the currently logged-in user

```java
Async.executeAsync(particleCloud, new Async.ApiWork<ParticleCloud, List<ParticleDevice>>() {

        public List<ParticleDevice> callApi(ParticleCloud particleCloud) throws ParticleCloudException, IOException {
            return particleCloud.getDevices();
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(List<ParticleDevice> devices) {
            for (ParticleDevice device : devices) {
                if (device.getName().equals("myDevice")) {
                    doSomethingWithMyDevice(device);
                    return;
                }
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(ParticleCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
            Toaster.l(myActicity.this, "Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
        }
});

```
---

#### Read a variable from a Particle device (Core/Photon)
This example assumes that `particleDevice` is an active instance of `ParticleDevice`, and the device it represents is claimed by the currently logged-in user.

```java
Async.executeAsync(particleDevice, new Async.ApiWork<ParticleDevice, Integer>() {

        public Integer callApi(ParticleDevice particleDevice) throws ParticleCloudException, IOException {
            return particleCloud.getVariable("myVariable");
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Integer value) {
            Toaster.s(MyActivity.this, "Room temp is " + value + " degrees.");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(ParticleCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
            Toaster.l(MyActivity.this, "Wrong credentials or no internet connectivity, please try again");
        }
});
```
---

#### Call a function on a Particle device (Core/Photon)
This example shows how to call a function on the device with a list of parameters.  The meaning of the value returned from `ParticleDevice.callFunction()` depends on the function itself, e.g., in Tinker:
* Using `digitalread`, this is the value read from the pin.
* Using `digitalwrite`, this value is a _result code_, indicating if the write was successful.

```java
Async.executeAsync(particleDevice, new Async.ApiWork<ParticleDevice, Integer>() {

        public Integer callApi(ParticleDevice particleDevice) throws ParticleCloudException, IOException {
            return particleCloud.callFunction("digitalwrite", list("D7", "1"));
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Integer returnValue) {
            Toaster.s(MyActivity.this, "LED on D7 successfully turned on");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(ParticleCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
        }
});
```
---

#### List device exposed functions and variables
`ParticleDevice.getFunctions()` returns a list of function names.  `ParticleDevice.getVariables()` returns a map of variable names to types.

```java
for (String funcName : particleDevice.getFunctions()) {
    Log.i("SOME_TAG", "Device has function: " + funcName);
}

Map<String, Object> vars = particleDevice.getVariables();
for (String name : vars.keySet()) {
    Log.i("SOME_TAG", String.format("variable '%s' type is '%s'", name, vars.get(name)));
}
```
---


#### Get a device instance by its ID

```java
Async.executeAsync(particleCloud, new Async.ApiWork<ParticleCloud, ParticleDevice>() {

        public ParticleDevice callApi(ParticleCloud particleCloud) throws ParticleCloudException, IOException {
            return particleCloud.getDevice("53fa73265066544b16208184");
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(ParticleDevice device) {
            myDevice = device;
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(ParticleCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", e);
        }
});
```
---

#### Rename a device
```java
Async.executeAsync(particleDevice, new Async.ApiWork<ParticleDevice, Void>() {

        public Void callApi(ParticleDevice particleDevice) throws ParticleCloudException, IOException {
            particleDevice.setName("rocket_bubble");
            return null; // return "Void"
        }

        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Void v) {
            Log.i("SOME_TAG", "Rename succeeded");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(ParticleCloudException e) {
            Log.e("SOME_TAG", "Rename failed", e);
        }
});
```
---


#### Logout
This logs out the user, clearing the user's session and access token.

```java
ParticleCloud.get(someContext).logOut()
```
---


### OAuth client configuration

If you're creating an app, you're required to provide the `ParticleCloudSDK` class with the OAuth clientId and secret. 
These are used to identify users coming from your specific app to the Particle Cloud.
Please follow the procedure decribed [in our guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide/how-to-build-a-product/web-app/#creating-an-oauth-client) to create those strings.
Then in you can supply those credentials in one of two ways: 
1. Set them as string resources, with the names `oauth_client_id` and `oauth_client_secret`, respectively.   These resources will be picked up by the SDK automatically.
2. If you would prefer not to ship these OAuth strings as Android resources, you can 
use an alternate SDK init method, `ParticleCloudSDK.initWithOauthCredentialsProvider()`.

For this latter option, you'll need to create a custom OauthBasicAuthCredentialsProvider implementation.  This is as simple as it sounds, e.g.:

```java
    ParticleCloudSDK.initWithOauthCredentialsProvider(context, new OauthBasicAuthCredentialsProvider() {

        public String getClientId() {
            return <however you want to provide this string>
        }

        public String getClientSecret() {
            return <however you want to provide this string>
        }
    });
```


### Additional reference
For more complete interface information, check out the [source code of ParticleCloud](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-android/blob/master/cloudsdk/src/main/java/io/particle/android/sdk/cloud/ParticleCloud.java) and [ParticleDevice](https://github.com/spark/spark-sdk-android/blob/master/cloudsdk/src/main/java/io/particle/android/sdk/cloud/ParticleDevice.java).

If you're working from Android Studio on OS X, you can get the Javadoc for each method or class by putting the cursor over it and hitting `F1`.


### Logging
HTTP logging can be configured by setting the `http_log_level` string resource.  Valid values are: `NONE`, `BASIC`, `HEADERS`, `HEADERS_AND_ARGS`, or `FULL`.

For example, to set logging to `BASIC`, you would add the following to your `strings.xml`:
```xml
<string name="http_log_level">BASIC</string>
```



## Installation

The SDK is available through [JCenter](https://bintray.com/particle/android/cloud-sdk/).  To install the Android Cloud SDK in your project, add the following to your app module Gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'io.particle:cloudsdk:0.2.2'
}
```

Also note that the SDK is hosted on JCenter, but not Maven Central.

Make sure your top-level Gradle file contains the following:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```
